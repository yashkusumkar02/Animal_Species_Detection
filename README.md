# Animal Species Detection | Web Application

This project is a machine learning-based web application designed to detect and classify animal species from images. The model was built using Python, Scikit-learn, and deployed via Flask. The user interface, created with HTML and CSS, ensures an intuitive experience for anyone wanting to upload images and get real-time results.

## Features:
- **Accurate Classification**: Classifies various animal species with a 45% improved accuracy after iterative enhancements.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for seamless interaction.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Built using Scikit-learn for model training and Flask for web deployment.
- **Real-Time Results**: Upload an image to get instant classification feedback.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** for backend development and model training
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms
- **Flask** for web framework and deployment
- **HTML/CSS** for front-end interface

### Installation and Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/animal-species-detection.git
   
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the application**:
   python app.py

## How It Works:
1. The model is trained using labeled animal species images.
2. Users can upload an image through the web interface.
3. The model processes the image and provides the classification result instantly.

Feel free to explore and contribute to further improve the accuracy and features of this application!
